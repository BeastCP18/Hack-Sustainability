                    <p>The map in the middle of your screen is a map of one of the floors of the Gonzaga Cantwell and Ruesch Building.
                        The map contains a dot that represents the location of every recycle bin and trash can in the hallway of that floor.
                        In order to change between the the floors, click on the buttons at the bottom of the screen.
